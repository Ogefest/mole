# TODO

Work that is agreed but not yet built. Finished items move to [DONE.md](DONE.md)
with a one-line note on how they were resolved, so this file stays a list of
what is left rather than a history.

Everything in this repository is written in English — it is an open source
project, and a contributor should never hit a wall of text they cannot read.

## Features

### User documentation

A directory of user-facing documentation, kept up to date: what this is, what it
does, and the main features, with screenshots so it is worth looking at. The
screenshots come from `make screenshots`, which photographs states the tests have
just asserted — so the documentation cannot drift into showing something that no
longer works.

## Notes

- Video preview is still a documented gap: it needs `qt6-multimedia-dev` and
  `qml6-module-qtmultimedia`, neither of which is installed here.
- Backends not yet written: SFTP, S3, WebDAV, NFS, SMB. The conformance suite is
  ready for them — a new backend's test file is a few lines that build a context
  and call `runFileSystemConformance()`, and it now also checks that a backend
  either reports access properly or admits it cannot.
- The terminal panel is Unix-only. Windows needs ConPTY, which is a different API
  entirely; `Pty` reports itself unavailable there rather than pretending.
- Parquet writing is out of scope. Reading a file is not a licence to rewrite it,
  and the same goes for the SQLite viewer, which opens read-only.
